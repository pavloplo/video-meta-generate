A clean Next.js starter using the **latest stable Next.js**, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the app router. The project contains both the frontend UI and API routes so you can build the experience and the serverless backend in one place.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the frontend.

## API routes

The starter API endpoint lives at:

```
GET /api/health
```

It returns a JSON payload confirming the service is ready. Add more endpoints in `src/app/api`.
